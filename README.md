# The creation of my Portfolio ðŸ“œ:
Hi, in this document, I'm going to briefly or attempt to briefly describe my process when creating my portfolio website. Soon after graduating from university and working on various projects, I was hit with a frustrating realization-there was no effective way to showcase them. This lack of a platform to demonstrate my skills and achievements was a significant motivator for me to create my own portfolio website.

That was one of the sparks that ignited my desire to create this project. The inspiration came from seeing other people's projects. On YouTube, it's easy to find many people's work, from front-end developers to AI and engineering; the possibilities are endless. This exposure, coupled with my decision to venture into Web development, led me to look at other junior web developers' portfolios, which in turn shaped my plan for how I wanted to showcase my projects and represent myself when designing my portfolio. 

The final push that solidified my decision to create a portfolio came after applying to WriteUpp, a company focused on improving the health sector. The person handling my application was not only friendly but also provided me with critical feedback on what I needed to improve to stand out. This feedback, coupled with the realization that without a portfolio, there was no way for them to validate my skills, underscored the importance of having a platform to showcase my work.

With this in mind, I decided to get to work on creating my first portfolio website. In retrospect, it's very apparent that I didn't have a plan when designing the project. I was mainly going with the flow and working off of high motivation to just be able to create something. Then again, if you were shown various other websites with unique designs, who wouldn't be massively enthusiastic to dive straight in. As much as I would love to rave about the positives in my first portfolio, such as creating my first platform to showcase my work and creating and setting my own deadlines for the completion of the project, in hindsight, it is massively overshadowed by the things I could've done to improve the quality of the portfolio. 

Color theory, font faces, styles, and responsiveness were all things I was taught during university but should have been put into practice outside of the classroom. In visibly seeing the improvements I needed to make, I have only gained/learned more from creating my first portfolio project. The skills and opportunities that emerged from this project far outweigh the negatives found after finishing. As you can see in the screenshot below, I was clearly working with no plan.

I failed to implement the color theory, font faces, styles, and responsiveness in my first portfolio; with this, I decided to emphasize creating a plan before I typed any code. While discovering different layouts and designs for junior portfolios, I stumbled upon concepts I had not considered the first time. Storyboarding or moodboarding is a technique to guide the flow and feelings of a user's interaction with a project. What better place to start creating my new portfolio than thinking about the effect/impression I wanted to leave on a user visiting my web page. I decided to make my mood board with Figma.

Figma was a vital tool for me during this project not only because it allowed me to cover all the bases I struggled to do the first time around but also because it's easy to access and allowed me to plan out thoroughly the flow of my website and web pages. From the mood board, I could discern the style and colors I wanted to represent. I enjoy minimalism and picked out the colors of yellow, gray, and blue due to their intrinsic representation. Yellow is used mainly to display joy/happiness, blue for trustworthiness, and grey for natural and compromising.

Moving onto font faces and styles, I decided to go with Cabin and Satoshi. Both are sans-serif fonts, and I decided on these 2 styles primarily because of their readability and the effect I wanted to capture. Satoshi is bold and stands out as friendly. At the same time, Cabin has the same effect. Still, it comes off as more formal without the same impact as using a serif font, mainly used in highly formal websites/websites with massive reputations like Ferrari.

The mobile first approach, what does that mean? Would have been my initial reaction had I been asked that on the first creation of my portfolio. This time around, I decided to create my project with mobile phones at the forefront of my design. Using Figma, I could plan out how I wanted my assets and website to react depending on the screen size, firstly working off of smaller devices and gradually increasing the sizes of my assets in accordance with the device used.

This project allowed me to see my skills, weaknesses, improvements, and more. I am proud of how the project is currently due not only to the amount of effort and time I've dedicated but also to seeing my application of skills learned over time come to fruition. While I was coding, there were things I decided not to include due to practicality and simply needing to learn how to code it myself. Hence, the final website only partially matches the layout and designs in Figma. Once again, I need to improve/work on many things. There are still things left to be completed on the website, such as adding animations, using Javascript for the contact form, and adding more impressive projects to my portfolio. 
If you have gotten this far, thank you for reading.
